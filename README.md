## Introduction
This project analyzes data from 672 NFL teams spanning 21 seasons to uncover insights into how key metrics, such as total yards and turnovers, impact team success. Through descriptive statistics and visualizations, this analysis sheds light on trends and factors influencing team performance.

---

## Dataset
- **Source**: [NFL Team Data 2003-2023](https://github.com/OpenDataO/NFL-Team-Data-2003-2023)
- **Contents**: Team records, passing/rushing metrics, penalties, turnovers, and other performance indicators.
- **Size**: 672 teams over 21 seasons.

---

## Goals
1. Investigate the correlation between total yards per game and team wins.
2. Examine how turnovers (fumbles, interceptions) affect win percentage.

---

## Methodologies
1. **Data Loading**: Importing datasets using Python.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, filtering variables, and standardizing data types.
3. **Descriptive Statistics**: Using Pandas to calculate statistical summaries.
4. **Data Visualization**: Scatterplots, bar charts, and line graphs created with Matplotlib to highlight trends.
5. **Data Aggregation**: Grouping data into bins for easier analysis of turnovers and yardage.

---

## Key Insights
- **Total Yards**: Teams with higher total yards per game tend to achieve more wins.
- **Turnovers**: A negative correlation exists between turnovers and win percentage; fewer turnovers often lead to better outcomes.
- Other factors like defense and special teams play critical roles in specific game scenarios.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git

2. Navigate to the project folder
   cd your_repository_name

3. Install the required Python packages
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Run the Python scripts to load, clean, and analyze the dataset.
2. View the generated visualizations in the visualizations/ folder or within the Jupyter Notebook.

## Technologies Used

**Python Libraries**:
   Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
   NumPy: Numerical computations.
   Matplotlib: Data visualization.
   
**Tools**:
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive coding environment.

## Conclusions

Teams that generate more total yards per game generally achieve more wins.
Reducing turnovers significantly boosts a team's win percentage.
While correlations exist, game-specific factors like defense and special teams can influence outcomes unpredictably.
This analysis underscores the complexity of predicting game outcomes, highlighting the importance of holistic team performance.
